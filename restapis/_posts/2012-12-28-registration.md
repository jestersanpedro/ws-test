### How an integrator can be registered to the Portal

An integrator can be registered to the Portal by inserting a record on the database,
until a user-interface has already been implemented to the Portal.

The web service **username**, **password** and **integrator ID** will be provided by the Super Admin.
These credentials are needed to be able to successfully use the web service ingestion.
